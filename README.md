Project: Real-Time Body Language Recognition with Webcam Feed

This project is a real-time body language recognition system that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques. It leverages the Mediapipe library for detecting and tracking landmarks on human faces, hands, and body poses. The goal of the project is to detect and classify specific body language gestures and display the results on a live webcam feed.

Code Summary:

Install and Import Dependencies: The required libraries, including Mediapipe, OpenCV, pandas, and scikit-learn, are installed and imported.

Make Some Detections: The code captures the webcam feed and utilizes the Mediapipe holistic model to detect and process facial landmarks, hand landmarks, and body pose landmarks. Detected landmarks are visualized using OpenCV drawing functions.

Capture Landmarks & Export to CSV: Landmarks data is captured and exported to a CSV file named 'coords.csv', which contains coordinates of face, pose, and hand landmarks for each frame along with the corresponding class name.

Train Custom Model Using Scikit Learn: The collected landmark data is read from the CSV file, processed, and split into training and testing sets. Several machine learning classification models (Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, RandomForest, GradientBoosting) are trained using the training data.

Evaluate and Serialize Model: The trained models are evaluated using accuracy metrics and serialized using the pickle library.

Make Detections with Model: The serialized model is loaded, and real-time webcam feed processing resumes. Detected body language gestures are classified using the trained model and displayed on the live feed, including the predicted class and its corresponding probability.

Usage:

Install the required dependencies using the following command: pip install mediapipe opencv-python pandas scikit-learn.

Run the script to start the webcam feed and perform real-time body language recognition. Press 'q' to quit the feed.

Note:

Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.
The accuracy of the recognition will depend on the quality of the training data and the performance of the chosen machine learning model.
